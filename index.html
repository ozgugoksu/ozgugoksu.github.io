			My name is Ozgu Goksu (Original : Özgü Göksu <a href="Argyle St 9.mp3">how to pronounce?</a>). I am a first year PhD student at University of Glasgow, and my supervisor is Dr. Nicolas Pugeault, and member of CVAS group.
			<br><br>
			Before my PhD, I did master at Gebze Technical University with Prof. Dr. Erchan Aptoula, and have an undergraduate degree from Gebze Technical University
			in Computer Science and Engineering. During my master, I worked as research assistant for 3 years at the same university, and worked as project member at
			my supervisor's TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) project.
